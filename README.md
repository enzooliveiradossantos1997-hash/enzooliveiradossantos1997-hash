<h1 align="center">Global Agritech Software Suite – by Enzo Oliveira dos Santos</h1>

gribusiness professional with a Bachelor's degree in *Agribusiness Management* and a *Master's in Software Engineering (in progress)*.  
I develop high-performance technology solutions for the agricultural sector with focus on *waste reduction, operational efficiency, data-driven decision-making, forecasting systems, and scalable digital infrastructure*.

This repository consolidates the core of my engineering work:  
*software, analytics and intelligence applied to agribusiness at a global scale*, designed for real-world application and scalability in large agricultural operations, including the United States market.

This repository centralizes my main applied agritech projects — all designed with international scalability in mind and fully adaptable to the U.S. agricultural ecosystem.

## Strategic Objective

Reduce losses and waste throughout the agricultural cycle (planting → harvesting → storage → distribution) through *software engineering, data analytics, and applied intelligence*, delivering real solutions with measurable economic impact.
